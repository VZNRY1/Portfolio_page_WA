    <h2> About Me</h2> 
    <span class = "vl"></span> 
    <p> Hello there! My name is Taj Bland. I have a Bachelor of Science in Communications. I majored in Creative Adveritsing with a minor in creative Writing. I've been interested in programming since I was a kid but couldn't quite teach myself the art. Other than that I am a photographer and designer. I also occasionaly fill in as a videographer. I want to eventually break into video game design and 3D-rendering. I love to listen to music and read in my free time.  </p>
