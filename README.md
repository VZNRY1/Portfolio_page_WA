## Description

I am a new full-stack developer who is creating his portfolio with the hope fo showing people my work to break into a new career field. I built this project to showcase my work and to build on it as a progress through out my journey as a developer. I was able to create a space for my work to reside from scratch. This also demonstrates my understanding of the basics of web development. I was ablt to learn more about how to develop a usable web application.
